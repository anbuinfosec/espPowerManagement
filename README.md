This project implements a self-contained ESP8266/ESP32 system that detects electricity availability by monitoring its own power state. It logs uptime, downtime, outages, and serves a local web dashboard with graphs.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic power detection** (no sensors needed)
- **Uptime & downtime tracking**
- **Daily & weekly analytics**
- **ESP-hosted web dashboard** (HTML + Chart.js)
- **Data storage in LittleFS** (7‚Äì30 days history)
- **Data persistence across reboots**
- **Optional LED/buzzer alert** on power restore


## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware

- ESP8266 (NodeMCU / Wemos D1 Mini) or ESP32
- USB charger (mains powered)
- No external sensors, RTC, or SD card required



## üöÄ Usage

1. **Clone/download** this repo.
2. **Default WiFi credentials:**
	- **SSID:** `Power House`
	- **Password:** `anbuinfosec123`
	- You can change these from the web dashboard after flashing.
3. **Flash to ESP8266/ESP32:**
	 - **On PC:** Use PlatformIO or Arduino IDE as usual.
	 - **On Android:**
		 1. Install [ArduinoDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.arduinodroid2) from Google Play Store.
		 2. Copy the project folder to your Android device (e.g., in `ArduinoDroid/sketchbook/`).
		 3. Open ArduinoDroid, open the project, and install all required libraries (see links above).
		 4. Connect your ESP8266/ESP32 to your phone/tablet via OTG cable.
		 5. Select the correct board and port in ArduinoDroid settings.
		 6. Compile and upload the sketch.
4. **Access** the ESP's IP address in your browser for the dashboard.



## üìÅ File Structure

- `src/main.cpp` ‚Äî Main firmware code
- `data/` ‚Äî LittleFS data folder (if needed)
- `README.md` ‚Äî This file
- `CHANGELOG.md` ‚Äî Version history and changes


## üì¶ Libraries Required

- [ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)
- [AsyncTCP (ESP32)](https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP) / [ESPAsyncTCP (ESP8266)](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP)
- [LittleFS](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs) (ESP8266) / [LittleFS_esp32](https://github.com/lorol/LITTLEFS)
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)


## üèóÔ∏è GitHub Actions: Automatic Build & Release

On every GitHub release, this project automatically builds and uploads pre-compiled firmware binaries for both ESP8266 and ESP32:

- `esp8266_framework.bin`
- `esp32_framework.bin`

You can download these files from the "Assets" section of each release on the [GitHub Releases page](../../releases).

**To flash:**
- Use [esphome-flasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher), [ESPTool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), or your favorite tool to upload the `.bin` file to your device.

**Workflow summary:**
- On every release, GitHub Actions builds both environments and attaches the binaries to the release automatically.
